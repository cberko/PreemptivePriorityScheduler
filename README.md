# CMPE322 Project 2 - Preemptive Priority Scheduler

## Overview
This project implements a preemptive priority scheduler for process management in a single-core CPU using C. It focuses on priority-based and round-robin scheduling for processes with equal priorities.

## Features
- Preemptive priority scheduling
- Round-robin algorithm for equal priority processes
- Accurate calculation of execution times
- Management of process definitions and instruction sets

## Prerequisites
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Makefile utility

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [repository URL]
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd [project directory]

## Usage
To run the scheduler:
1. Compile the program:
make scheduler
2. Execute the scheduler:
./scheduler

## Processes and Instructions
- Processes are constant.
- Instruction times within each process are constant.

## Output
The scheduler will produce outputs based on the provided specifications, including waiting times and turnaround times for each process.
